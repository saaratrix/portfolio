                <h3>3D room decorator</h3>
                <p>
                    I worked on a 3D room decorator with a team where we ported a <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> app to the browser using <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/">BabylonJS</a>.
                    I wrote most of the 3D parts in the app.
                    The UI and social aspects were written using <a href="https://canjs.com/">CanJS</a>.
                    Most of the UI such as the left side menu is done by other people.
                    The project can be found here: <a href="https://www.egowall.com/">www.egowall.com</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The room decorator has 1000+ different furnitures in 4 different LOD levels.
                    The lighting is very simple.
                    There is a light directly above making everything cast a shadow straight down and everything is rendered with phong shading.

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li class="item">
                            <div class="img-wrapper">
                                <a href="files/roomdecorator/simple_view.jpg">
                                    <img src="files/roomdecorator/simple_view.jpg" alt="A room with some furnitures.">
                                </a>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The video shows some of the very basic manipulation a user can do with furnitures.
                    It has translation, rotation and scaling and later in the video a uesr is adding a furniture from their inventory.
